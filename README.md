# Week 3 Headstarter Accelerator Project 3 Brain Tumor Classification with Neural Networks
Brain Tumor Classification with Neural Networks
In this project, you will learn how to train neural networks to classify tumors in brain MRI scans. You will learn about how to construct different neural network architectures through transfer learning and custom convolutional layers, and use the Gemini 1.5 Flash model to generate explanations for the model's predictions.
